> It has been superseded by [zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng) and [Slicer/zlib-ng](https://github.com/Slicer/zlib-ng), the corresponding Slicer fork with minor customizations to streamline integration.
>
> [zlib version 1.2.3](https://zlib.net/) was originally released on July 18, 2005. Since at least 2012, CTK and 3D Slicer have relied on this [CMake-enabled fork](https://github.com/commontk/zlib) of zlib 1.2.3.
>
> In the years since, official and modernized versions of zlib have become available on GitHub:
>
> - [madler/zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib) — the canonical zlib source
> - [zlib-ng/zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng) — a performance-oriented fork with full CMake support.
>
> For more context on this transition, see Slicer pull request [#6708](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/6708).
